## Overview

Boundary or contour detection is an important
problem in computer vision and is well studied. Other important
problems like hierarchical image segmentation can be reduced
to a contour detection problem. A version of the state-of-the-art
edge detection algorithm Pb-Lite is discussed in this project. The
Pb Lite approach causes a jump in the performance of boundary
detection by suppressing false positives in the textured regions
due to the coupling of multiscale local texture, brightness, and
color information with a globalization framework.


## Dependencies
